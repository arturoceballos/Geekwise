                        <div class="block-content">
                            <p>The Geekwise Academy Cohort program has been developed to bridge the gap between Geekwise Academy course students and their ability to move into roles as developers in the local technology industry. <br>
                                <br>
                            The Cohort consists of two phases.  The first is a two week internship for the 20 individuals that were invited to the Cohort program. This phase includes QA and testing of the invitees skill set. In phase two, 8 of the 20 Invitees will be chosen to participate in a 24 week internship program. Phase two consists of three assignments each eight weeks in length. During this time the Cohorts will complete work for clients through projects of increased difficulty. Also, Cohort participants will be required to co-teach Geekwise Academy classes. They will work with  the Cohort Director and Bethany Garoupa to prepare for this opportunity.<br>
                            <br>
                            Our goal here is simple, we want to produce developers that are:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Information literate</li>
                                <li>Confident in their problem solving abilities</li>
                                <li> Reliable and professional</li>
                                <li>Good communicators</li> 
                                <li>Driven to succeed
                                And able to learn and receive criticism</li>
                            </ol>   
                            Bitwise Industries is excited about this new adventure that kicks off  on January 12, 2015. We look forward to mentoring the next generation of technologists in Fresno.

             <div class="bio"> When I was first invited to the Cohort, I felt extremely humbled. I wanted to be a part of something big. Bitwise is not only helping local developers, but the whole Central Valley in general. After the Cohort I want to stick around Bitwise and further my knowledge.</div>

            <div class="bio">Why did I want to be a part of the Cohort? I want to do better things for Bitwise. Becoming an elite cohort developer sounded like the best way to do just that. Once I've completed the Cohort I plan on working full time using my newly found skills to be a part of the full time dev team for Edit LLC. </div>
